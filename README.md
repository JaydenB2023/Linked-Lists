# Linked-Lists

It should have:

An insert to head function
a function to search the linked list for a user-entered int
a function to delete a node while keeping the list intact
create a list that holds the numbers 1 2 3.  Remember you're inserting to the head, so you'll need to enter 3,2,1 to get a list that looks like 1->2->3->NULL

search for the number 2 and print how many steps it took to find, and then print the address that 2 points to

insert 5 and 4, so your list looks like 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

delete 1 so your list looks like 4->5->2->3->NULL

search for the number 2 and print how many steps it took to find, and then print the address that 2 points to
